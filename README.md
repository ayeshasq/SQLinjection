# 🛡️ SQL Injection Paper 1

**Detecting SQL Injection Attacks in Web Apps Using Machine Learning**

---

## 📚 Overview

This project presents a robust system for detecting SQL Injection attacks in web applications using Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, Naïve Bayes, SVM) enhanced with stacking for improved accuracy.  
It secures user data with **AES encryption** & **MD5 hashing**, includes UML/ER models, a GUI tool (**SQLX**), and comprehensive testing (black-box, grey-box, white-box) for real-time prevention.
